# React Todo List

In this exercise I want you to create a todo list with React Typescript. The todo list is will be simple, not any fancy functionalities or animations _(unless you relly want to get creative)_. The purpose is to solve as much as possible with React and apply a react mindset.

The exercise comes in two steps that you must follow. Each step comes with a set of user stories. A user story is basically just a requirement of your application but it comes like a description of a feature.

Read the instructions carefully and and don't try to do everything at the same time. Work user story for user story.

## Step 1

Remember here to use state und utilize props. Also place the state(s) in the appropriate component(s).

- As a user I want to be able to view all my todos in the same place, to get a good overview of what I have to do.

- As user I want to be able to add new todos to my todo list so I can update my todo list when I find something else that I need to do.

- As a user I want to mark a todo as completed so I can see which todos I have left to do.

- As a user I want to remove a todo from the list so I can keep my list as clean and short as possible.

- As a user I want a timestamp to be added to my new todos in order better se how old all the todos are.

- As a user I want to be able to put my name _(author of a todo)_ on a todo, so everyone in my family can add their own todos to the todo list.

## Step 2 - Extra features

- As a user I want to be able to edit existing todos in case I remember something that has to do with a specific todo.

- As a user I want to be able to move todos up and down in order to prioritize what I have to do.

- As a user I want to be able to sort my todos after either timestamp or author.
